# This is a test in a nested directory
All of these tests should be the same except the top header and this number:
4
## Here is a smaller header
I'm adding *emphasis* to test

There should be a linebreak above this. This is a continuation of the same line to test how it handles longer lines and line wrapping. I still need more text, and so this text shall be that "more text" that I was just speaking of. Ooh, self reference/recursion.

## more headers

some text with **even more emphasis**
